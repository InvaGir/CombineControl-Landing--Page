                    <h1>Attention Citizens of City 45!</h1>
                    <p>Combine Control is dying, This time its not a joke! We need your help.

                        We wouldn't ask you this if it did not matter and it also puts us in an embarrassing situation but... 
                               <br>
                            <br>
                        We desperately need monthly donations to keep the servers and forum up, We have to pay 350$ every 6 months for the VPS service and 250$ every 12 months for the web hosting.
                                <br>
                            <br>
                                <br>
                        Delay in payment may lead to shuting down the servers and probably also the entire community permanently!
                            <br>
                                <br>
                        By donating you will also get cool benefits and privileges like extra skill points, higher prop limit, custom scoreboard title and much more.
                        We also have a 'Contributor Status' that will grant you speical privileges in the forums and its only for 5$.
                                <br>
